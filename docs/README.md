# Component Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for all reusable components in the project.

## Documentation Standards

All components should be documented using the [Component Template](./component-template.md). This ensures consistency and completeness across all component documentation.

## Documentation Guidelines

### When to Document
Document a component when:
- It's used in multiple places
- It has configurable props/behavior
- It implements complex accessibility features
- It has specific design requirements
- Other developers will need to use it

### Documentation Process
1. Copy the [component template](./component-template.md)
2. Fill in all relevant sections
3. Include real code examples
4. Test all examples work correctly
5. Review for accessibility completeness
6. Update the main README with component link

### Review Process
- All component documentation should be reviewed by the UI team
- Documentation should be updated when components change
- Regular reviews ensure documentation stays current

## Best Practices

### Writing Examples
- Use realistic, practical examples
- Show both basic and advanced usage
- Include error handling where relevant
- Test all code examples

### Accessibility Documentation
- Always include accessibility considerations
- Document ARIA attributes and their usage
- Explain keyboard navigation behavior
- Include screen reader considerations

### Maintenance
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Review documentation quarterly
- Archive documentation for deprecated components
- Link to related components and alternatives

## Contributing

When adding new components:
1. Create documentation before or alongside the component
2. Follow the established template structure
3. Include comprehensive examples
4. Test accessibility features
5. Update this README with the new component
